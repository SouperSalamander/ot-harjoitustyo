# Project Secification

## Purpose of the Application

This program will provide step by step solutions for some simple number theory problems: **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**, **Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)**, and **Prime Factorisation**. 

## Users

The intended users for this program will be students around middle school age. This is when most children are first introduced to concepts like **GCF** and **LCM** so the program go along with, and aid, their learning.

However, the aim is to make this program user friendly without being childish. This makes it an appropriate resourse for anyone who may find this useful.

## Draft of User Interface

## Basic Functionality 

### Before Login

The user will be given the choice between **Log In**, **Create Account**, or **Exit**. 

If they choose to log in, they will be asked for a username and password. If this account exists the user will be taken to the main part of the program.

If they choose to create an account theY will be asked to input a unique username and password. If the account already exists it will notify the user of this where they can then log in. If the account doesnt exist, it will be created and from there the user can log in.

Choosing exit will close the program.

The reason for having the user log in before using the program is so that they can access their usage history.

### After Login

The user will be given the choice between **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**, **Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)**, **Prime Factorisation**, and **Exit**. 

Choosing exit will close the program.

The other three buttons will take the user to a part of the program where they will be able to input numbers and the selected operation will be carried out. The program will then output a step by step solution.

## Ideas for Further Development

This project is one that could be easily expanded on in a variety of ways.

More topics can be added. As an example, converting recurring decimals to fractions, or percentage increase/decrease.

As well as this, the program could include an area to quiz the user on these topics. This would allow for progress to be tracked over time. With this, there could even be a competative aspect against other users. This would be especially good in a school setting as it would really encourage young people to spend time practising these techniques.
